# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data, specifically the confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases globally. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python, and visualization through Tableau and Power BI. The objective is to provide insights into the progression and impact of COVID-19 across various countries and regions.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: 
   - Data is cleaned and processed using Python to handle missing values, create new features like active cases and death rates, and aggregate data for time-series analysis.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - EDA is performed to understand the trends and distributions of COVID-19 cases and deaths over time. Descriptive statistics are calculated, and key metrics such as the top affected countries, active case trends, and case fatality rates are analyzed.
   
3. **Tableau Dashboard**:
   - A dashboard is created in Tableau, visualizing key trends such as global case progression, country comparisons, and active case trends. Interactive filters and maps allow users to explore the data at different granularities.
   
4. **Power BI Dashboard**:
   - Another dashboard is built in Power BI, providing comprehensive insights into regional and global COVID-19 data, with added slicers for filtering data by country and time.
